# Firebase Hosting Configuration Summary

## Work Completed for Step 3

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Updated `.env.production` to point to the Cloud Run backend URL:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=https://media-portal-backend-335217295357.us-west1.run.app/api
     VITE_FILE_SERVER_URL=https://media-portal-backend-335217295357.us-west1.run.app/files
     ```

2. **Firebase Configuration Files**
   - Created `firebase.json` with:
     - Deployment to the `dist` directory
     - URL rewrites for single-page application (SPA) routing
     - Appropriate caching headers for static assets
   - Created `.firebaserc` specifying the GCP project ID: `legislativevideoreviewswithai`

3. **Build Verification**
   - Successfully tested the build process with `npm run build`
   - Verified the generation of optimized files in the `dist` directory

4. **Documentation**
   - Created detailed deployment instructions in `FIREBASE_DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - Updated the main `README.md` with Firebase Hosting information
   - Updated the migration plan to reflect progress

## Next Steps for Step 3 Completion

1. **Update Backend CORS Configuration**
   - Run the provided script: `./update_cors.py`
   - This will update the backend to only accept requests from Firebase Hosting domains
   - These changes need to be deployed with the backend in Step 4

2. **Firebase CLI Installation**
   - Install the Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
   - Log in to Firebase: `firebase login`

3. **Deployment**
   - Run `firebase deploy --only hosting` from the frontend directory
   - Verify the application is available at:
     - https://legislativevideoreviewswithai.web.app
     - https://legislativevideoreviewswithai.firebaseapp.com

4. **Verification After Deployment**
   - Confirm the application loads correctly:
     - Check the browser console for any errors
     - Verify the UI renders properly
   - Test navigation (all routes):
     - Navigate to /videos, /audio, /transcripts pages
     - Test filtering and search functionality
   - Verify API connections to the Cloud Run backend:
     - Check network requests in browser DevTools
     - Confirm data is loaded from Firestore (not mock data)
   - Test media playback from Cloud Storage:
     - Play a video sample
     - Play an audio sample
     - Open a transcript

## Important Notes

- Ensure the Cloud Run backend is properly configured with CORS headers to accept requests from the Firebase Hosting domains
- The Cloud Run backend must be deployed and accessible before finalizing the Firebase Hosting deployment
- If API calls fail after deployment, verify that the correct Cloud Run URL is being used and that the backend is properly configured
