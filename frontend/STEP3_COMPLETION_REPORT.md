# Step 3 Completion Report: Firebase Hosting Deployment

## Summary
We have successfully completed Step 3 of the GCP Migration Plan by configuring and deploying the Vue.js frontend to Firebase Hosting. The frontend is now live and accessible at https://legislativevideoreviewswithai.web.app.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Updated `.env.production` with the Cloud Run backend URL
   - Set file server URL to point to the Cloud Run backend

2. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Created `firebase.json` with SPA routing configuration and caching rules
   - Created `.firebaserc` specifying the correct GCP project ID

3. **Backend CORS Preparation**
   - Analyzed current CORS configuration in the backend
   - Created `update_cors.py` script to update CORS settings to allow Firebase Hosting domains
   - Added instructions for updating backend CORS settings as part of Step 4

4. **Deployment**
   - Built the Vue.js application using `npm run build`
   - Successfully deployed to Firebase Hosting
   - Verified the deployment was accessible at https://legislativevideoreviewswithai.web.app

5. **Documentation**
   - Created `FIREBASE_DEPLOYMENT.md` with detailed deployment instructions
   - Updated the project `README.md` with Firebase Hosting information
   - Updated the Migration Plan to mark Step 3 as completed

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Deployment (Step 4)**
   - Implement the CORS updates to allow connections from Firebase Hosting domains
   - Containerize and deploy the backend to Cloud Run
   - Verify frontend-backend connectivity

2. **Testing After Backend Deployment**
   - Verify all API endpoints work correctly
   - Test media playback from Cloud Storage
   - Test filtering and search functionality with real data

## Post-Deployment Notes

The frontend is now successfully deployed to Firebase Hosting, but it requires a working backend on Cloud Run to function properly. Until Step 4 is completed, the frontend will fall back to using mock data.

Once the backend is deployed to Cloud Run and the CORS configuration is updated, the frontend will connect to Firestore through the backend API, completing the cloud migration architecture for the frontend portion of the application.
