# Fixed Media Portal Backend Deployment

## Previous Issues (Now Resolved)

We previously identified the following issues with the Cloud Run deployment:

1. **API Implementation Mismatch**: The Dockerfile was initially configured to deploy the simplified API rather than the full-featured `api_firestore.py` which contains all the endpoints needed by the frontend.

2. **Missing Dependencies**: The Dockerfile was missing some required dependencies like `pydantic`, `google-auth`, and `python-dotenv` needed by the full API.

3. **Frontend Configuration**: The frontend environment settings needed to be synchronized with the Cloud Run service URL.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Updated Dockerfile**: Modified the Dockerfile to:
   - Use the complete `api_firestore.py` for all functionality
   - Include all necessary dependencies 
   - Copy the required `firestore_db.py` module
   - Set proper environment variables
   - Update the CMD to use uvicorn properly

2. **Improved Deployment Script**: Enhanced the `deploy_cloud_run.sh` script to:
   - Automatically check if the frontend configuration matches the deployed service URL
   - Provide clear instructions if the URLs don't match

## Current Status

The current deployment at `https://media-portal-backend-335217295357.us-west1.run.app` is using the full-featured API.

**Note:** The simplified API file (`simple_firestore_api.py`) was removed from the codebase on March 28, 2025 to avoid confusion.

## How to Deploy

1. Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy_cloud_run.sh
   ./deploy_cloud_run.sh
   ```

3. After deployment, verify the API is working by visiting:
   - Health check: `https://DEPLOYED_URL/api/health`
   - Root page: `https://DEPLOYED_URL/`

4. Update the frontend configuration if needed:
   - Edit `frontend/.env.production`
   - Set `VITE_API_URL` to `https://DEPLOYED_URL/api`

## Troubleshooting

If the page at `https://media-portal-backend-335217295357.us-west1.run.app` is not displaying properly:

1. **Check Service Status**: Verify the service is running in the Google Cloud Console
2. **Check Logs**: Review Cloud Run logs for errors
3. **Test API Endpoints**: Try specific endpoints like `/api/health` or `/api/videos`
4. **Check CORS Configuration**: Make sure your frontend origin is allowed in the CORS middleware
5. **Verify Firestore Connection**: Ensure the service account has the proper permissions
