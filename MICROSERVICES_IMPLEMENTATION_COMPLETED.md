# Microservices Implementation Completed

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a complete microservices architecture for the Idaho Legislature Media Portal API. This document summarizes the work completed, the structure of the implementation, and recommendations for further improvements.

## Microservices Implemented

1. **Gateway Service** - Central routing hub for all API requests
2. **Health Service** - System health monitoring and status checks
3. **Video Service** - Management of video content and metadata
4. **Audio Service** - Management of audio content and metadata
5. **Transcript Service** - Management of transcript content with related media references
6. **Stats Service** - System statistics and filter options

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- **GET `/api`** - API information and available endpoints
- **GET `/api/health`** - Health check endpoint

### Media Endpoints

- **GET `/api/videos`** - List all videos with filtering options
- **GET `/api/videos/{id}`** - Get a specific video by ID
- **GET `/api/audio`** - List all audio files with filtering options
- **GET `/api/audio/{id}`** - Get a specific audio file by ID
- **GET `/api/transcripts`** - List all transcripts with filtering options
- **GET `/api/transcripts/{id}`** - Get a specific transcript by ID

### Related Media Endpoints

- **GET `/api/videos/{id}/transcripts`** - Get transcripts related to a video
- **GET `/api/audio/{id}/transcripts`** - Get transcripts related to an audio file

### Statistics and Filters

- **GET `/api/stats`** - Get media statistics (counts of videos, audio, transcripts)
- **GET `/api/filters`** - Get available filter options (years and categories)

## Implementation Features

### 1. Flexible Import System

The codebase uses a flexible import system that handles both direct imports and relative imports. This ensures the code works correctly in both development and deployment environments:

```python
# Handle both direct import and relative import
try:
    from ..common.utils import setup_logging
except ImportError:
    from common.utils import setup_logging
```

### 2. Database Access Layer

A centralized database service handles all Firestore interactions using a singleton pattern to prevent multiple database connections:

```python
# Singleton database client
_db_client = None

def get_db_client():
    global _db_client
    if _db_client is None:
        _db_client = firestore.Client(project=project_id)
    return _db_client
```

### 3. Data Models

Each service has its own data model that handles conversion between Firestore documents and application objects:

```python
@dataclass
class TranscriptItem:
    id: str
    title: str
    # Other fields...
    
    @classmethod
    def from_firestore(cls, doc_id, doc_data):
        # Convert Firestore document to TranscriptItem
        
    def to_dict(self):
        # Convert TranscriptItem to dictionary for API response
```

### 4. Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling ensures the API remains responsive even when underlying services fail:

```python
try:
    # Service logic
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
    # Fall back to mock data or return error response
```

### 5. Mock Data

Each service includes mock data for development and testing when Firestore is unavailable:

```python
def get_mock_transcripts():
    """Return mock transcripts for testing"""
    return [
        {
            "id": "mock_transcript1",
            "title": "House Floor - Budget Discussion",
            # Other fields...
        }
    ]
```

### 6. Extensible Filtering

All media services support filtering by year, category, and search terms:

```python
def get_all_transcripts(year=None, category=None, search=None, limit=100):
    # Apply filters if provided
    if year:
        transcripts_ref = transcripts_ref.where('year', '==', year)
    
    if category:
        transcripts_ref = transcripts_ref.where('category', '==', category)
```

## Deployment

The microservices are deployed as a Cloud Function using a deployment script that:

1. Creates a deployment package with all required files
2. Deploys to Google Cloud Functions
3. Tests all endpoints to verify correct operation

## Future Improvements

1. **Pagination** - Add support for paginating results for large collections
2. **Caching** - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Authentication** - Add authentication for admin endpoints
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement detailed logging and monitoring
5. **Advanced Search** - Add full-text search capabilities
6. **Media Uploading** - Add endpoints for uploading new media files

## Conclusion

The microservices architecture has been successfully implemented, providing a clean separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and a solid foundation for future enhancements. The API now supports all required media types (videos, audio, and transcripts) with consistent filtering, search, and relationship functionality.
