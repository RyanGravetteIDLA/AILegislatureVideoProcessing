## What Was Migrated

1. All transcript records (52) from SQLite database have been migrated to Firestore documents in the `transcripts` collection.
2. All video files (59) have been migrated to Firestore documents in the `videos` collection.
3. All audio files (55) have been migrated to Firestore documents in the `audio` collection.
4. All media files have been uploaded to Firebase Cloud Storage (bucket: `legislativevideoreviewswithai.firebasestorage.app`) with consistent path schemes:
   - transcript/{year}/{category}/{filename} for transcripts
   - video/{year}/{category}/{filename} for videos
   - audio/{year}/{category}/{filename} for audio files
5. The server code has been updated to use the Firestore API instead of SQLite.

## How to Use the New System

The application has been configured to use Firestore and Google Cloud Storage by default. To run the system with the new cloud-based backend:

```bash
python run_server.py
```

This script sets all the necessary environment variables and launches the server with the Firestore backend.

## Service Account Credentials

The service account credentials are located at:
```
/Users/ryangravette/Downloads/cloudrunkey.json
```

This file contains the Google Cloud service account credentials that provide access to:
- Firestore database
- Firebase Cloud Storage

Make sure to keep this file secure and do not commit it to version control.

## Running Tests

To test the Firestore connection:

```bash
python firestore_test.py
```

## Running API Server Only

To run just the API server (no file server):

```bash
python run_server.py --api-only
```

## Running File Server Only

To run just the file server:

```bash
python run_server.py --file-only
```

## Fallback to Original SQLite

If needed, the original SQLite-based API can still be accessed by:

1. Running the original server.py:
```bash
python -m src.server
```

2. Or by modifying the run_api function in server.py to use "api:app" instead of "api_firestore:app".
