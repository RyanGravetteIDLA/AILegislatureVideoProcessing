# Microservices Architecture Plan for Idaho Legislature Media Portal

## 1. Overview

Breaking down our monolithic Cloud Function into a microservices architecture offers several advantages:
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and testing
- Independent deployability
- Scalability of individual components

## 2. Proposed Microservices

### 2.1. API Gateway Service
- **Purpose**: Entry point for all API requests, handles routing and basic auth
- **Endpoints**: Routes to appropriate microservices
- **File**: `gateway_service.py`

### 2.2. Health Service
- **Purpose**: System health monitoring and status checks
- **Endpoints**: `/api/health`
- **File**: `health_service.py`

### 2.3. Video Service
- **Purpose**: Manages all video-related operations
- **Endpoints**: `/api/videos`, `/api/videos/{id}`
- **File**: `video_service.py`

### 2.4. Audio Service
- **Purpose**: Manages all audio-related operations
- **Endpoints**: `/api/audio`, `/api/audio/{id}`
- **File**: `audio_service.py`

### 2.5. Transcript Service
- **Purpose**: Manages all transcript-related operations
- **Endpoints**: `/api/transcripts`, `/api/transcripts/{id}`
- **File**: `transcript_service.py`

### 2.6. Stats Service
- **Purpose**: Provides system statistics and metrics
- **Endpoints**: `/api/stats`, `/api/filters`
- **File**: `stats_service.py`

## 3. Shared Components

### 3.1. Database Layer
- **Purpose**: Centralizes database access logic
- **File**: `db_service.py`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Connection management
  - Data retrieval
  - Data transformation

### 3.2. Authentication/Authorization
- **Purpose**: Manages authentication and authorization
- **File**: `auth_service.py`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Validate requests
  - Manage permissions

### 3.3. Common Utilities
- **Purpose**: Shared utility functions
- **File**: `common_utils.py`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Error handling
  - Logging
  - Response formatting

## 4. Deployment Structure

### 4.1. Cloud Functions Approach
- Each microservice deployed as a separate Cloud Function
- Shared code through GCP Cloud Function libraries
- API Gateway maps to each function

### 4.2. Directory Structure
```
/src/cloud_functions/
├── main.py                # Entry point that routes to services
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies for all services

```

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Structure
1. Create directory structure
2. Set up shared components
3. Create initial service stubs

### Phase 2: Implement Core Services
1. Implement Health Service
2. Implement Video Service
3. Implement Gateway routing

### Phase 3: Implement Additional Services
1. Implement Audio Service
2. Implement Transcript Service
3. Implement Stats Service

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
1. Test each service independently
2. Deploy as separate Cloud Functions
3. Set up API Gateway routing

## 6. Benefits of This Approach

1. **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently
2. **Maintainability**: Smaller codebases are easier to maintain
3. **Development**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously
4. **Resilience**: Service failures are isolated
5. **Deployment**: Changes can be deployed to individual services without affecting others

## 7. Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for each service
2. Integration tests for service interactions
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
4. Performance tests for scalability

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

1. Centralized logging for all services
2. Performance metrics for each service
3. Alerts for service degradation
4. Dashboard for system health

## 9. Security Considerations

1. Service-to-service authentication
2. Request validation at API Gateway
3. Proper error handling to prevent information disclosure
4. Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

## 10. Next Steps

1. Create basic directory structure
2. Implement shared utilities
3. Implement health service as proof of concept
4. Gradually migrate functionality from monolithic function
