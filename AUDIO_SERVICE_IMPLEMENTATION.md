# Audio Service Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Audio Service as part of the microservices architecture for the Idaho Legislature Media Portal.

## Components Implemented

1. **Audio Model (`models/audio.py`)**
   - Implemented the `AudioItem` data class
   - Added methods to convert between Firestore documents and AudioItem objects

2. **Audio Service (`services/audio_service.py`)**
   - Implemented the service to retrieve audio files with filtering options
   - Added methods to get a specific audio file by ID
   - Included fallback to mock data when Firestore is unavailable

3. **Gateway Integration**
   - Updated the Gateway Service to route audio-related requests to the Audio Service
   - Added endpoints for `/api/audio` and `/api/audio/{id}`

4. **Stats Service Enhancement**
   - Updated the stats service to include audio files in filter options
   - Ensured audio counts are correctly reported in statistics

5. **Mock Data**
   - Added mock audio data for testing when Firestore is unavailable

## API Endpoints

1. **GET `/api/audio`**
   - Returns a list of all audio files
   - Supports filtering by year, category, and search term

2. **GET `/api/audio/{id}`**
   - Returns a specific audio file by ID

## Data Model

The `AudioItem` data model includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the audio file
- `title`: Title of the audio file
- `description`: Description of the audio file
- `year`: Year the audio was recorded
- `category`: Category of the audio (e.g., House Chambers)
- `date`: Date the audio was recorded
- `duration`: Duration of the audio
- `url`: URL to access the audio file

## Deployment

The Audio Service is deployed as part of the microservices architecture using Cloud Functions. The deployment script has been updated to include all necessary components.

## Future Improvements

1. Add pagination support for large collections
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed audio files
3. Add search functionality across audio transcripts
4. Implement audio file metadata extraction
5. Add support for audio file format conversion
