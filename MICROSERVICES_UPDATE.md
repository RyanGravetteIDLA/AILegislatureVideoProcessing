# Microservices Implementation Update

## Overview

We've refactored the backend API from a monolithic Cloud Function to a microservices architecture. This update improves maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.

## Key Changes

1. **Modular Architecture**: Decomposed the single Cloud Function into multiple service modules
2. **Improved Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated service files
3. **Gateway Pattern**: Centralized routing through a gateway service
4. **Data Models**: Formalized data models for each entity type
5. **Database Abstraction**: Centralized database access in a dedicated service

## Directory Structure

```
/src/cloud_functions/
├── main.py                # Entry point
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
├── services/
│   ├── gateway_service.py # API Gateway service
│   ├── health_service.py  # Health check service
│   ├── video_service.py   # Video service
│   └── ...                # Other services
├── common/

└── models/
    ├── video.py           # Video data models
    └── ...                # Other models
```

## Deployment

A new script has been created to deploy the microservices structure:

```bash
./deploy_microservices.sh
```

## Testing

You can test the microservices locally using:

```bash
cd src/cloud_functions
python test_local.py
```

## URLs

The API remains accessible at the same URLs:

- Primary URL: https://media-portal-api-6alz6huq6a-uw.a.run.app
- Alternative URL: https://us-west1-legislativevideoreviewswithai.cloudfunctions.net/media-portal-api

## Frontend Integration

The frontend continues to work with the new microservices architecture without any changes to the API contract. The environment variables have been updated to point to the microservices API.

## Future Expansion

This architecture allows for easier expansion in these areas:
- Adding new endpoints for additional media types
- Implementing advanced search functionality
- Adding authentication and authorization
- Implementing caching for improved performance
